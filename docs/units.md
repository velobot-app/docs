# Units
Every Man's Land stores a wide variety of data, typically in the following
units:

* **Weight:** kilograms (kg)
* **Distance:** kilometers (km)
* **Power:** watts (W)
* **Speed:** kilometers per hour (km/h)
* **Cadence:** revolutions/steps/strokes/etc. per minute (rpm, spm, ...)
* **Fluid volume:** liters (L)
* **Energy:** kilocalories (kcal or Cal)
* **Temperature:** degrees Celsius (C)
* **Heart rate:** beats per minute (bpm)
* **Duration:** seconds (s)
* **Height:** centimeters (cm)
* **Altitude:** meters (m)

Geographic data (such as location) is transmitted as GeoJSON.

Users can still elect to view their data in imperial units (for relevant data
points), but the API always uses metric.
